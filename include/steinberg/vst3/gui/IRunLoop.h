         * On Linux the host has to provide this interface to the plug-in as there's no global event run loop
         * defined as on other platforms.
         *
         * This can be done by IPlugFrame and the context which is passed to the plug-in as an argument
         * in the method IPlugFactory3::setHostContext. This way the plug-in can get a runloop even if
         * it does not have an editor.
         *
         * A plug-in can register an event handler for a file descriptor. The host has to call the event
         * handler when the file descriptor is marked readable.
         *
         * A plug-in also can register a timer which will be called repeatedly until it is unregistered.
