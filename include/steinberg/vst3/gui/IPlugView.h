     * Plug-in definition of a view.
     *
     * Sizing of a view
     *
     * Usually, the size of a plug-in view is fixed. But both the host and the plug-in can cause
     * a view to be resized:
     *   - Host: If IPlugView::canResize () returns kResultTrue the host will set up the window
     *     so that the user can resize it. While the user resizes the window, IPlugView::checkSizeConstraint()
     *     is called, allowing the plug-in to change the size to a valid supported rectangle size.
     *     The host then resizes the window to this rect and has to call IPlugView::onSize().
     *   - Plug-in: The plug-in can call IPlugFrame::resizeView() and cause the host to resize the window.
     *
     * Afterwards, in the same callstack, the host has to call IPlugView::onSize() if a resize is needed (size was changed).
     * Note that if the host calls IPlugView::getSize() before calling IPlugView::onSize() (if needed),
     * it will get the current (old) size not the wanted one!!
     *
     * Here the calling sequence:
     *   - plug-in->host: IPlugFrame::resizeView (newSize)
     *   - host->plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the currentSize (not the newSize!)
     *   - host->plug-in: if newSize is different from the current size: IPlugView::onSize (newSize)
     *   - host->plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the newSize
     *
     * Please only resize the platform representation of the view when IPlugView::onSize() is called.
     *
     * Keyboard handling
     *
     * The plug-in view receives keyboard events from the host. A view implementation must not handle
     * keyboard events by the means of platform callbacks, but let the host pass them to the view. The host
     * depends on a proper return value when IPlugView::onKeyDown is called, otherwise the plug-in view may
     * cause a malfunction of the host's key command handling.
     *
     * @see IPlugFrame, @ref platformUIType
