     * Plug-in view content scale support
     *
     * This interface communicates the content scale factor from the host to the plug-in view on
     * systems where plug-ins cannot get this information directly like Microsoft Windows.
     *
     * The host calls setContentScaleFactor directly before or after the plug-in view is attached and when
     * the scale factor changes while the view is attached (system change or window moved to another screen
     * with different scaling settings).
     *
     * The host may call setContentScaleFactor in a different context, for example: scaling the plug-in
     * editor for better readability.
     *
     * When a plug-in handles this (by returning kResultTrue), it needs to scale the width and height of
     * its view by the scale factor and inform the host via a IPlugFrame::resizeView(). The host will then
     * call IPlugView::onSize().
     *
     * Note that the host is allowed to call setContentScaleFactor() at any time the IPlugView is valid.
     * If this happens before the IPlugFrame object is set on your view, make sure that when the host calls
     * IPlugView::getSize() afterwards you return the size of your view for that new scale factor.
     *
     * It is recommended to implement this interface on Microsoft Windows to let the host know that the
     * plug-in is able to render in different scalings.
