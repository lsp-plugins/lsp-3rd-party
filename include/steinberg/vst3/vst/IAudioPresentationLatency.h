         * device itself.

         * @note for Output Presentation Latency: when writing to a file, the last plug-in will have an output presentation latency
         * set to zero.
         *
         * When the output of this plug-in is connected to an audio device, the initial output latency is the output
         * latency of the audio device itself.

         * A value of zero either means no latency or an unknown latency.

         * presentation latency of the next plug-ins in the mixer routing graph and will modify the output presentation latency
