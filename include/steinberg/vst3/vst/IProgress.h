         * Extended host callback interface for an edit controller
         *
         * Allows the plug-in to request the host to create a progress for some specific tasks which take
         * some time. The host can visualize the progress as read-only UI elements. For example,
         * after loading a project where a plug-in needs to load extra
         * data (e.g. samples) in a background thread, this enables the host to get and visualize the current status of the loading
         * progress and to inform the user when the loading is finished.
         *
         * @note During the progress, the host can unload the plug-in at any time. Make sure that the plug-in
         * supports this use case.
         *
         * @example
         *   //--------------------------------------
         *   // we are in the editcontroller:
         *   // as member: IProgress::ID mProgressID;
         *

         *   if (progress)

         *   // ...
         *   myProgressValue += incProgressStep;
