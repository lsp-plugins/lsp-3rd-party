         * Bus Description
         *
         * A bus can be understood as a "collection of data channels" belonging together.
         * It describes a data input or a data output of the plug-in.
         * A VST component can define any desired number of busses.
         * Dynamic usage of busses is handled in the host by activating and deactivating busses.
         * All busses are initially inactive.
         * The component has to define the maximum number of supported busses and it has to
         * define which of them have to be activated by default after instantiation of the plug-in (This is
         * only a wish, the host is allow to not follow it, and only activate the first bus for example).
         * A host that can handle multiple busses, allows the user to activate busses which are initially all inactive.
         * The kMain busses have to place before any others kAux busses.
         * See also: IComponent::getBusInfo, IComponent::activateBus
