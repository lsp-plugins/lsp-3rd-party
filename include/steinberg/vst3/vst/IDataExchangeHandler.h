         * Host Data Exchange handler interface.
         *
         * The IDataExchangeHandler implements a direct and thread-safe connection from the realtime
         * audio context of the audio processor to the non-realtime audio context of the edit controller.
         * This should be used when the edit controller needs continuous data from the audio process for
         * visualization or other use-cases. To circumvent the bottleneck on the main thread it is possible
         * to configure the connection in a way that the calls to the edit controller will happen on a
         * background thread.
         *
         * Opening a queue:
         * The main operation for a plug-in is to open a queue via the handler before the plug-in is activated
         * (but it must be connected to the edit controller via the IConnectionPoint when the plug-in is using
         * the recommended separation of edit controller and audio processor). The best place to do this is in
         * the IAudioProcessor::setupProcessing method as this is also the place where the plug-in knows the
         * sample rate and maximum block size which the plug-in may need to calculate the queue block size.
         * When a queue is opened the edit controller gets a notification about it and the controller can
         * decide if it wishes to receive the data on the main thread or the background thread.
         *
         * Sending data:
         * In the IAudioProcessor::process call the plug-in can now lock a block from the handler, fill it and
         * when done free the block via the handler which then sends the block to the edit controller. The edit
         * controller then receives the block either on the main thread or on a background thread depending on
         * the setup of the queue.
         * The host guarantees that all blocks are send before the plug-in is deactivated.
         *
         * Closing a queue:
         * The audio processor must close an opened queue and this has to be done after the processor was
         * deactivated and before it is disconnected from the edit controller (see IConnectionPoint).
         *
         * What to do when the queue is full and no block can be locked?
         * The plug-in needs to be prepared for this situation as constraints in the overall system may cause
         * the queue to get full. If you need to get this information to the controller you can declare a
         * hidden parameter which you set to a special value and send this parameter change in your audio
         * process method.
