         * Extended IAudioProcessor interface for a component.
         *
         * To get accurate process context information (Vst::ProcessContext), it is now required to implement
         * this interface and return the desired bit mask of flags which your audio effect needs. If you do not
         * implement this interface, you may not get any information at all of the process function.
         *
         * The host asks for this information once between initialize and setActive. It cannot be changed afterwards.
         * This gives the host the opportunity to better optimize the audio process graph when it knows which plug-ins
         * need which information.
         *
         * Plug-Ins built with an earlier SDK version (< 3.7) will still get the old information, but the information
         * may not be as accurate as when using this interface.
